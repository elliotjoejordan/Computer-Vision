To Run HOG detection:
navigate to python-bow-hog-object-detection-master and run hog_detector.py
This will run using the SVM in the directory. 
The variable 'directory_to_cycle' can be used to select which images will be used for the driving simulation. The directory must contain left_images and right_images directories.

Multiple SVMs are included, and can be changed by altering the parameter in the params.py file.

The training data set has been omitted due to size constraints.
